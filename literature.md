## Moral relativism
Morality aka ethics differs in every society, and is a convenient term for socially approved habits

Cultural relativism says there is no universal truth to ethics 

 There is no objective standard to benchmark other cultures. We can only compare it to our own

The moral differences argument tries to derive a conclusion from the disagreement of people. That's invalid. The argument is failing

If we accept cultural relativism. We cannot criticize other cultures. Because there is no objective standpoint. We can't improve or criticize our own morals. Because it wouldn't be accepted by the morals.


There is much less disagreement than there seems to be. Mostly because of beliefs not because of values. Also customs and circumstances lead to other choices

Shared moral rules are sometimes necessary. For example the rule against murder. A society cannot exist without it

We may judge a particular cultural aspect to be un desirable. We might even condemn a certain aspect. This way we can still be tolerant of a culture.


By knowing the differences in morality across cultures and especially our own we, broaden our minds


## subjectivism in ethics

Morality is a matter of sentiment rather than reason

Simple subjectivism states that moral claims made by individuals only describe how individuals think. It is a safe way to reason. There are no disagreements because I know how my morally disagreeing neighbour thinks and I can only acknowledge his opinion as his and only his.

Emotivism describes expression of opinion not as a moral statement of your own, but as a activating sentence. E.g I disapprove of gays, is the same as "don't be gay". Moral disagreement is a disagreement in attitude according to Emotivism. Disagreement has to be explicit, as in plans or action.

The error theory states that people are trying to say "good" things. People are not reporting their attitudes or feelings. However they are in error. They both claim to have a correct value but there is none

The denial of value is at the heart of subjectivusm. The theory is a called nihilism. They believe values are not real. Both seem less plausible when applied to simple matters. It is a theory which is hard to refute but doesn't attract lots of people to believe in.

Ethics cannot be put in merely two camps. It isn't just subject to opinions or touchable objectivism. There is also reason, a value is good if it is backed by better reasons than the alternatives.

## Game theory

A decision made in ignorance is the position in which the player knows the choices and outcomes. But doesn't know the probabilities to these outcomes. Therefore a decision matrix with lots of high values does not mean there is a high chance you will get those

The maximum principle focuses on the worst possible outcome for each act, and tries to maximize it.

The leximin principle is maximin with an extension. If the worst case is equally as bad as other we continue the algorithm on the second worst for each act.


Basic concepts and zero sum games

In game theory your actions have probabilities that depend in your choices.

The prisoners dilemma is not a zero sum game. The loss and gain are not exactly the opposite of what the other player makes. The zero sum is always negative because they always have to serve.

The Nash equilibrium is the decision which will eventually be the outcome of a game, given that both players choose rationally. Thus for the prisoners dilemma both will confess.

Nonzerosum games can have multiple mixed equalibria and moreover equalibria can be mixed. That is, one player benefits more than the other. 

Pareto optimal. The state in which both have the highest outcome.


### Cooperative games

Most cooperative games can be reduced to non cooperative games

### Iterative games

Finite and infinite. Finite prisoners dilemma is same as the one round version. In the last round you always play dominantly and confess. The round before you also do that because there is no reward. And so on...

Tit for that, give a little bit. And if returned continue to deliver the Pareto optimal case

The grim trigger is a tit for that variant that only keeps cooperating if the other player also cooperates.

Iterated games have too many equalibria to select the best one.

## The utilitarian approach

Morality is about making the world as happy as possible.
The principe of utility: in all circumstances, maximize happiness. It isn't following a Bible book or a set of static rules.

Bentham: people should be free to do whatever they want - whatever they think will make them happy - so long as they are not harming others.

Mill:
"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."

Utilitiarians value pleasure a lot.

Animals can suffer, thus they can be unhappy. In which case the Utilitiarians will say morality applies to animals as well. Humans and nonhumans are equally entitled to moral concern.


## The debate over utilitarianism


Equal amounts of happiness always count equally. Most moral philosophers reject the classical utilitarianism theory.

In utilitarianism right actions are things that bring good. Good is happiness according to the utilitarian. And happiness means pleasure.

Other things besides happiness are also of importance, such as friendship and artistic creativity

According to utilitarianism consequences of actions, namely hapiness, is all that matters.

1. It Conflicts with justice. If riots occur after a crime because of race. It would be beneficial for the utilitarian to convict a innocent person for example. This is in conflict with Justice.
2. It conflicts with rights. If a woman is undressing and one takes pictures in secret and shares it among his peers, the peers would feel happy, while the unaware lady isn't unhappier. This would he allowed under utilitarianism.
3. Backward looking. Utilitarianism makes the past irrelevant. Thus we can continue canceling appointments of you with another for example, as long the sum of happyness is positive.

**Should we be equally concerned by everyone?**

So, should we treat everyone's hapiness as equal?

No,
1. The charge that utilitarianism is too demanding. In the western world we should get as poor as the African fellow, who could spend our money in a better way. We cannot make our own lives meaningful anymore because of the requirement to promote general welfare.
2. The charge that utilitarianism disrupts our personal relationships. We would like to treat friends and family with priority over others. Utilitarianism forbirds this.


**Defenses of utilitarianism**

1. Contesting the consequences. In most of the situations long term consequences invalidate the counter examples. Only some specific counter examples would target the theory. Weak defense.
2. The principe of utility is a guide for choosing rules, not acts. Called rule-utilitarianism. But what if a "forbidden" act would greatly increase the overall good? We cannot patch this flaw in rule-utilitarianism
3. The whole "common sense" is wrong
  - all values have a utilitarian basis
  - our gut reactions can't be trusted when cases are exceptional. Some lies do bring us hapiness for example.
  - we should focus on all the consequences.
